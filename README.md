*This project is a school project to discover the WebGL library*

This is a game write with WebGL. You can play it [here](https://pierre-monier.github.io/angry-sharks/).

You can run the game locally with `npx serve` if you have nodeJs on your computer. Every web server will do the work ;).

We have a score board feature thanks to google firebase firestore and google cloud functions. We add a lame security system because our schoolmates were cheating a lot ^^
